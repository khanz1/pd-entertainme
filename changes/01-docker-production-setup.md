# Production Docker Setup for Server

## What was changed

- Added health check endpoint at `/api/health`

### Enhanced Package Scripts

- Added `build` script for TypeScript compilation
- Added `start` and `start:prod` scripts for production
- Created `tsconfig.build.json` for production builds

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
- Implemented Docker Hub integration
- Added automated EC2 deployment process

### Development Environment

- Added `.dockerignore` for optimal Docker builds
- Created production environment configuration template
- Added comprehensive documentation

## Files Created/Updated

### Created Files:

- `server/Dockerfile` - Multi-stage Docker build configuration
- `server/tsconfig.build.json` - TypeScript build configuration
- `server/.dockerignore` - Docker ignore rules
- `server/env.production.example` - Production environment template
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
- `README.Production.md` - Production deployment guide

### Updated Files:

- `server/package.json` - Added build and production scripts
- `server/src/apis/app.controller.ts` - Added health check endpoint
- `server/src/apis/app.router.ts` - Added health check route

## Technical Implementation

### Docker Multi-Stage Build

The Dockerfile implements a two-stage build process:

**Stage 1 (Builder)**:

- Uses Node.js 22 Alpine base image
- Installs all dependencies (including dev dependencies)
- Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
- Optimizes for build speed

**Stage 2 (Production)**:

- Uses clean Node.js 22 Alpine base image
- Installs only production dependencies
- Copies compiled application from builder stage
- Runs as non-root user for security
- Exposes configurable port (default: 8000)

### Health Check Implementation

Added robust health monitoring:

- Status endpoint returning application state
- Uptime tracking
- Environment information
- Version tracking
- Timestamp for monitoring

### CI/CD Pipeline Features

- Automated testing before deployment
- Docker image building and pushing
- Secure deployment to EC2 instances
- Container health verification
- Rollback capability through container management

## Pros

### Performance Benefits

- **Optimized Image Size**: Multi-stage build reduces final image size by excluding dev dependencies and source files
- **Fast Startup**: Pre-compiled JavaScript eliminates TypeScript compilation at runtime
- **Efficient Caching**: Docker layer caching speeds up subsequent builds

### Security Improvements

- **Non-root User**: Application runs as `node` user, reducing security risks
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Production image contains only necessary files
- **Secure Secrets Management**: Environment variables handled through GitHub Secrets

### Operational Excellence

- **Automated Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments through GitHub Actions
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks for monitoring and alerting
- **Consistent Environment**: Docker ensures consistent runtime across environments
- **Easy Rollback**: Tagged images allow quick rollback to previous versions

### Development Workflow

- **Separation of Concerns**: Client and server can be deployed independently
- **Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling through container replication
- **Environment Parity**: Development and production environments are consistent

## Cons

### Complexity

- **Learning Curve**: Team needs Docker and containerization knowledge
- **Debugging Overhead**: Debugging containerized applications can be more complex
- **Infrastructure Dependencies**: Requires Docker Hub, GitHub Actions, and EC2 setup

### Resource Requirements

- **Memory Usage**: Docker containers have slight memory overhead
- **Storage**: Docker images require additional disk space
- **Network**: Image pulling requires bandwidth

### Operational Considerations

- **Monitoring Complexity**: Need to monitor both container and application health
- **Log Management**: Container logs need aggregation for production monitoring
- **Secret Management**: Additional complexity in managing environment variables securely

## Potential Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: Container Health Check Failures

**Symptoms**: Deployment reports unhealthy application
**Causes**:

- Database connection issues
- Missing environment variables
- Port binding conflicts

**Fix Steps**:

1. Check container logs: `docker logs pd-entertainme-server`
2. Verify environment variables: `docker exec pd-entertainme-server env`
3. Test database connectivity manually
4. Ensure port 8000 is available and accessible

### Issue 2: Build Failures in CI/CD

**Symptoms**: GitHub Actions workflow fails during build step
**Causes**:

- Test failures
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Missing dependencies

**Fix Steps**:

1. Run tests locally: `npm run test`
2. Check TypeScript compilation: `npm run build`
3. Verify all dependencies are in package.json
4. Check GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages

### Issue 3: Deployment Timeouts

**Symptoms**: Deployment script times out during container startup
**Causes**:

- Database connection delays
- Heavy initialization processes
- Resource constraints

**Fix Steps**:

1. Increase health check timeout in deployment script
2. Optimize application startup time
3. Check EC2 instance resources
4. Verify database/Redis availability

### Issue 4: Environment Variable Issues

**Symptoms**: Application fails to start with configuration errors
**Causes**:

- Missing required environment variables
- Incorrect secret format in GitHub
- Environment variable formatting issues

**Fix Steps**:

1. Validate all required variables are set in `PROD_ENV_FILE` secret
2. Check environment variable format (no quotes around values)
3. Verify secret is properly formatted (Unix line endings)
4. Test environment file locally

## Migration Guide

### From Development to Production

1. **Environment Setup**: Copy `env.production.example` to create production environment file
2. **Secret Configuration**: Add all secrets to GitHub repository settings
3. **Database Setup**: Configure PostgreSQL and Redis on EC2 or use managed services
4. **First Deployment**: Push to production branch to trigger initial deployment
5. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure application monitoring and alerting

### Security Checklist

- [ ] Strong JWT secret generated
- [ ] Database credentials secured
- [ ] API keys configured
- [ ] EC2 security groups configured
- [ ] HTTPS configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Regular security updates scheduled
