## Technical Implementation Details

### Components Used

- `Card` components for section organization
- `Avatar` with fallback for user profile pictures
- `Badge` components for genre tags and statistics
- `Button` components with variants for actions
- `Skeleton` components for loading states
- `MovieCard` for movie display consistency

### Data Processing

## Potential Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: Genre Analysis Performance

**Problem**: Processing genres for large favorite lists might be slow
**Fix**: Implement memoization using `useMemo` hook

```typescript
const topGenres = useMemo(() => {
  // Genre analysis logic here
}, [favorites]);
```

### Issue 2: Empty State Experience

**Problem**: New users see mostly empty statistics
**Fix**: Add onboarding guidance and sample data suggestions

### Issue 3: Mobile Performance

**Problem**: Large movie grids might affect mobile performance
**Fix**: Implement virtualization for large lists or pagination
