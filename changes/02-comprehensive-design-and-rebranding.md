## Cons

### Infrastructure Complexity

- **Multiple Services**: More moving parts to monitor and manage
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Dependency on multiple cloud providers
- **Cost Monitoring**: Need to track costs across multiple services
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand multiple platforms

### Migration Requirements

- **Data Migration**: Existing data needs migration to Supabase
- **Environment Setup**: New environment variables and configurations
- **DNS Changes**: Domain configurations need updates
- **Team Training**: Learning new deployment processes

### Operational Considerations

- **Monitoring Complexity**: Need unified monitoring across services
- **Debugging**: Distributed systems can be harder to debug
- **Network Dependencies**: Relies on internet connectivity between services
- **Backup Strategy**: Coordinated backup across multiple services

## Potential Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

**Symptoms**: Frontend can't connect to backend API
**Causes**:

- Incorrect CORS configuration
- Mismatched domains between Vercel and EC2

**Fix Steps**:

1. Update server CORS configuration to allow Vercel domain
2. Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` points to correct EC2 endpoint
3. Check that EC2 security groups allow inbound connections
4. Test API endpoints directly via curl/Postman

### Issue 2: Database Connection Issues

**Symptoms**: Server can't connect to Supabase database
**Causes**:

- Incorrect connection string format
- IP restrictions on Supabase
- Connection pool exhaustion

**Fix Steps**:

1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` format matches Supabase requirements
2. Check Supabase dashboard for connection limits
3. Ensure EC2 IP is whitelisted in Supabase (if IP restrictions enabled)
4. Monitor connection pool usage in application logs

### Issue 3: Redis Queue Processing Failures

**Symptoms**: AI recommendations not generated
**Causes**:

- Upstash Redis connection issues
- BullMQ configuration problems
- Memory limits exceeded

**Fix Steps**:

1. Test Redis connection: `redis-cli -u $REDIS_URL ping`
2. Check Upstash dashboard for memory usage and connection stats
3. Verify BullMQ configuration matches Upstash settings
4. Monitor queue job processing in application logs

### Issue 4: Vercel Build Failures

**Symptoms**: Frontend deployment fails
**Causes**:

- Environment variables not set
- Build timeout issues
- Dependency conflicts

**Fix Steps**:

1. Check Vercel build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all required environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
3. Test build locally: `npm run build`
4. Check for dependency version conflicts in package.json

### Issue 5: PWA Installation Issues

**Symptoms**: App install prompt not showing
**Causes**:

- Manifest.json misconfiguration
- Missing service worker
- HTTPS requirements not met

**Fix Steps**:

1. Validate manifest.json using Chrome DevTools
2. Ensure all required PWA criteria are met
3. Test on multiple browsers and devices
4. Verify HTTPS is properly configured
